      <h2>The Bablebaby Story</h2>
      <p>Bablebaby was founded by two parents who wanted to raise multilingual children but struggled to find quality language instruction. We believe that playtime and childcare should involve educational enrichment activities.</p>
  
      <p>That's why we created an online platform to connect families like yours with qualified multilingual babysitters from around the world. Our sitters transform ordinary childcare into an immersive language learning experience!</p>

      <h2>Our Vetting Process</h2>
      <p>We undertake robust vetting and screening to ensure that only the best sitters join our community:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Identity and background verification</li>
        <li>Video interviews in their non-native language</li>
        <li>Reference and experience checks</li>
        <li>Ongoing parent ratings and reviews</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>World-Class Language Instruction</h2>
      
      <p>Our sitters utilize proven techniques like songs, stories, games, and activities to seamlessly teach vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar, and conversation skills.</p>
  
      <p>We continuously monitor child progress and provide supplemental learning materials to parents like flashcards, books, and more based on their proficiency level.</p>
